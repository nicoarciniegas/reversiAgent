# reversiAgent (Javascript)

TuringianosAgent is an intelligent Reversi (Othello) agent developed using the Negamax algorithm with memoization.
The agent evaluates board positions based on multiple heuristics, including positional advantage, mobility, and stability, dynamically adjusting its search depth according to the game phase (opening, midgame, and endgame).

Designed for competitive play and efficient decision-making, this project demonstrates strategic AI behavior, optimization through caching, and adaptive depth control for improved performan
